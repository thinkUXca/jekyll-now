          <p>Singularity University had launched an online learning portal to complement their offline offerings, and engaged with us to help them increase the number of people starting their introductory course and signing up for their course series. We performed an expert evaluation and comparative analysis to identify some areas for improvement, and designed new wireframes for key screens.</p>

          <p>The Child Development Research Unit (CDRU) is a research laboratory at the University of Guelph that studies developmental issues related to child health. We were hired to help the CDRU researchers design and build a virtual reality (VR) training system to help teach children to cross the street more safely, in a number of realistic suburban environments. This work has been featured in the Toronto Star and City News, and preliminary studies have shown promising results.</p>

          <p class="services">User Interviews &bull; Expert Evaluation &bull; UX Design &bull; Wireframes &bull; Prototyping &bull; Usability Testing</p>
          <p>TripSeer is a web application offering intelligent trip planning and itinerary management. It allows users to create trips with multiple destinations, and manage accommodations, activities, and travel methods between their destinations. The client approached us because they were concerned that while the application was rich with features, it was too complex for users to manage easily. We worked with TripSeer to redesign the landing page and trip planning flow, and tested the designs with users.</p>
