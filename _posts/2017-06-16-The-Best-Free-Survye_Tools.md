title: The Best Free Survey Tools
author: jonathan
---

We're a small company with enough things to spend money on. Creating surveys for clients isn't something we do
frequently enough (yet) to justify the monthly cost of tools like SurveyMonkey or SurveyGizmo, so we went on a hunt for the best free survey tool.  

## Survey Tool Requirements ##
Our baseline requirements for basic surveys are:

* Ask ~20 questions
* Get unlimited results
* Create matrix rating questions (a user is asked to rate a number of things on a scale, e.g., from 'very unlikely' to 'very likely')
* View individual and tabulated results
* Export results

## Overview of Free Plans ##

Here is a summary of the free plans of tools that we tested, in alphabetical order.

<p style="font-size: 70%">* The ThinkUX rating is a subjective number based roughly on the following factors:
the ability of each tool's free plan to meet the requirements laid out above, the UX of the tool, and the aesthetic appeal of the tool
and its surveys. We are in no way associated with any of these companies.</p>


### Google Forms ###

9.5 / 10

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/GoogleForms-add_question.png"
  class="img-responsive"
  alt="Google Forms Add Question"
  />

#### The good ####

I stopped reviewing other tools after I reviewed Google Forms. There was no need to continue. In typical google fasion, it does almost
everything we need it to do in a very intuitive manner. You can create unlimited surveys, with unlimited questions and collect
unlimited responses. You can create matrix questions, export data straight into google sheets, see individual and tabulated
responses, and layout your survey exactly as you please. Notably, Google Forms includes skip logic. This is a rare and beautiful
thing in a free tool.

#### The bad ####

All in all, for a free tool, this is quite an incredible product. If I'm nitpicking:

* The aesthetic is less appealing than some of the other tools.
* There aren't as many question types, and the question types don't have
as many features (for example, you can't have a textbox beside a multiple choice/checkbox answer) but I haven't run into a situation
yet that I needed to do something that I couldn't find a work-around for (granted, small sample).
* The inability to move pages around is a nuissance.

### SurveyGizmo ###

8/10

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/surveygizmo-add_question.png"
  class="img-responsive"
  alt="SurveyGizmo Add Question"
  />

#### The good ####

The SurveyGizmo interface is very clean and user friendly. They have some neat metrics for each survey on the dashboard, like fatigue score and accessibility, as well
as the estimated survey length in minutes (though this seems to disappear after collecting responses). Creating
surveys and adding questions is a breeze.

Survey results are also very well done. You can view individual
responses, and create reports of tabulated responses. The reports are customizable so you can choose which type
of chart to display, or to filter your data on a per-question basis.

#### The bad ####
* **Free Plan Show-stopper**: can't create matrix questions

With the free tool, you're limited to 8 basic question types. This is unfortunate, because other aspects of the tool are very
well done, and we would have liked to use the tool.

Note: you can't customize the look & feel of your survey in the free plan.

### SurveyHero ###

6/10

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/SurveyHero-add_question.png"
  class="img-responsive"
  alt="SurveyHero Add Question"
  />

#### The good ####

The drag and drop interface for creating questions and surveys is very intuitive. You can lay your survey out just
the way you want to. Also, you can create matrix questions!  Sure, they're not perfect visually (the ranking appear to
run together and are not visually distinct), but you can create them, so that's a plus.

#### The bad ####
* **Free Plan Show-stoppers:**
    * Can't export results
    * When viewing results, you can't change chart types or get required data

You can't change chart types, or export results in the free plan. This is acceptable for some question types, like multiple choice,
but for data matrix questions, the results are fairly useless: it doesn't tell you
the distribution of the responses (e.g. how many people selected each rating for each row)!  It only shows mean and variation,
which in a matrix, are not very insightful. If you want the data, you have to either tabulate it yourself (good luck), or upgrade.


### SurveyMonkey ###

7.5 / 10

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/SurveyMonkey-add_question.png"
  class="img-responsive"
  alt="SurveyMonkey Add Question"
  />

#### The good ####

SurveyMonkey is probably the most well-known survey tool out there. It's easy to use, it's visually appealing, and it's
extremely feature rich.

#### The bad ####

* **Free Plan Show-stoppers:**
    * Can't export results
    * 10-question / survey limit

While there's no denying the ease of using SurveyMonkey, the fact that the free plan limits you to 10 questions makes
this severely limited and in almost all cases, unusable as a free option. They will allowing you to create an entire survey,
and test it out, before finding out that the free plan only allows 10 questions. There is no warning when you add an 11th question,
or 12th, or 20th. Only when you are ready to send it out to participants will you find out that the free plan is limited to 10 questions.
This is deceptive, which is not a great feeling to evoke in potential customers.

### SurveyPlanet ###

3/10

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/SurveyPlanet-add_question.png"
  class="img-responsive"
  alt="Survey Planet Add Question"
  />

#### The good ####

You can create unlimited surveys and questions, and collect unlimited responses. If you need to create very
simple surveys, this might meet your needs. You can customize the survey design in the free plan. Also,
it's easy to prevent multiple submissions from the same device.

#### The bad ####

* **Free Plan Show-stoppers:**
    * Can't create matrix questions
    * Can't chage chart types when viewing results
    * Can't export data

Overall, the interface is a bit clunky, and it's not a feature-rich survey tool. Matrix questions aren't
available in either the free or the paid plans. For results, you can't change chart types in the free plan, nor can you
export data. Additionally, there is no option to add pages or change how the survey is delivered to participants: it's one question at a time.

### Zoho Survey ###

5 / 10

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/ZohoSurvey-add_question.png"
  class="img-responsive"
  alt="SurveyHero Add Question"
  />

#### The good ####

Zoho Survey, for it's lack of visual appeal, does a very good job of creating surveys. It supports creating matrix
questions in the free plan, and adding new questions and pages is simple.

#### The bad ####

* **Free Plan Show-stopper:** can't export results or customize reports

The major kickers are the inability to export data and customize reports in the free plan. Visually, I would liken it to
softare written by developers for power users. It feels like the 90's up in here. It's very efficient, but not
all-together very pretty.


### Summary ###

By no means does this cover all of the survey tools with free plans. In fact, (it barely scrathes the surface)[http://www.capterra.com/survey-software/].
We reviewed some of the most common tools, and stopped when we found one that was acceptable for our current purposes.  We are using Google Forms for our
initial surveys, and should the time arise where we need to have more professional looking surveys (Google Forms' flat design is not the most appealing, nor
the most customizable option out there), we will likely look more deeply at SurveyGizmo and SurveyMonkey.  Hope this helps!
