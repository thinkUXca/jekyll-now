description: This is the final post in a three part series on the user experience (UX) of form design. This post discusses how to decrease the perceived costs of a form, to tilt the scales in favor of having it filled out.

In part I and part II of this form design series, I proposed a method of thinking about form design in terms of a user’s cost-benefit analysis, and discussed ways of increasing the perceived value of the form. In this post I’ll discuss the research and methods behind reducing the user’s perceived cost of filling in a form.

# “How much will it cost me?” #

The cost of filling in a form isn’t usually financial. It relates to the perceived **time**, **effort**, and **information** required to fill in a form. If you’ve done your best to make the value of filling in the form clear, you’re on your way to higher conversions (i.e. percentage of people that complete the form). However, that’s only half the equation. The second question a user asks when deciding to fill in a form is “How much will this cost me?”

# Types of Perceived Costs #

There are three types of costs that a user incurs when filling out a form:
* Time
* Effort
* Information (privacy)

**Time is related to form length and field types.**
* Single vs. multi-page forms
* Field types: text input, textareas, dropdowns, etc.

**Information is related to how a person perceives the value of their information:**
* Types of information requested
* Name, email, phone number, address, etc.

## Perceived Cost: Time ##

It's commonly stated that shorter forms are better and you should use short forms if you want more conversions. 
This may or may not be true (as we’ll see later), but it ignores the most important question in determining form length: 
**are you trying to get as many leads as possible (quantity), or fewer leads that are higher quality?**

### Determine The Business Goals ###

In most cases, forms are used to generate leads. Determining if lead quantity or lead quality is more important is the most 
influential factor when designing form length. **In general, if you want a higher quantity of leads, use a shorter form. 
If you want higher quality leads, use a longer form.**

The business motivation varies from situation to situation, and from company to company. For example, a startup without many leads may want to generate as many leads as they can because they’re doing all they can to create contacts, build their brand, etc. A well-established company with a broad and deep network likely does not have the same motivation. They still want to generate leads, but the quality of those leads is more important.

## Reduce The Perceived Form Length ##

Intuitively, if a form *looks* too long, users are less likely to engage with the form. While I haven’t been able to find any 
concrete data on the optimal number of fields to display on a single page form, 
[one recommendation](https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/designing-more-efficient-forms-structure-inputs-labels-and-actions/) is to 
display no more than 5-7 fields on a page before considering breaking a form up into multiple pages.
